From homework 4 --> problems 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8

  1.) Redo Problem 3 of Homework 3 with a random forest classifier. Compare your results with those from Homework 3.
  
  2.) Redo Problem 4 of Homework 3 with a random forest classifier.
  
  6.) For this problem, we provided you with two data sets, one for training and one for testing. In both cases, the data comes as (x, y) pairs (x is augmented).
  
     a) Apply linear regression to the training data and this will produce a weight vector w (augmented). 
        Using w, we can define a linear function y = f(x) = wT x (x is augmented). Is this a reasonably 
        good model for the training data? (You can calculate the mean square error of this model on the 
        training data and/or plot this function and the training data together).
     
     b) See if the f(x) (i.e., w) you find in part a) performs well on testing data.
     
  7.) Repeat Problem 6 on the data set we provided for this problem (Problem 6). Does the linear regression still work well? If yes, why? If not, why not?
  
  8.) Repeat Problem 7 using a neural network. Is your result better than that of Problem 7?
